# Health_Calculator
[Use cases](./docs/use_cases.md)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[Models](./docs/models.md)
## Introduction
A Web App that orients different types of users to calculate their dietary intake and analyzes the healthiness of their
diet, plus giving them advice that makes their diet more balanced and healthier.

### Purpose
- Help all kinds of people (athletes, average people, pregnant women, patients, etc.) to build a healthy diet.
- The goal of this project is to build an App that will fit users from amateur to expert since most of the dietary Apps are not friendly to users who do not know about a balanced diet or professionals.
- Many dietary Apps are too complex that they include some other functions (like calorie burn, fitness course, etc.) which make their Apps unprofessional.
